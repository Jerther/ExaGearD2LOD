# ExaGearD2LOD
This is just an AutoIT script that launches Game.exe with -w so the game runs with DirectDraw.
# HOWTO
- Download the executable file (see "releases" section)
- Unzip the file rund2.exe
- Copy the file alongside Diablo 2 files in ExaGear
- In ExaGear, go in rund2.exe properties and set resolution to 800x600
- Launch the game with rund2.exe

The game runs in windowed mode. This is not perfect, but it's still very playable!

Enjoy :)
